Hello World, 

My goal is to orchestrate efforts to help communities participate in our evolving education system and the economy. 
I'll do this through the following:
Create Partnerships with individuals and organizations to help everyone evolve, increase their value, and the income associated with it. 
Provide Experiential Learning Opportunities - Apprenticeships and Mentorships (get paid to learn while doing real work)
Creating a Community Marketplace. This will be a place to see what you've learned and done. Show others and find ways to make money in the community. It will also come with a social currency that is exchangeable for the US dollar, but is made to trade within the community.
