STEAMcoin
STEAMcoin is a currency that is exchangeable for the US Dollar, but is meant to be traded within the community as a barter currency and a virtual stock in the community itself.
STEAMcoin allows individuals to pay extremely small or large sums of money for transactions of every kind. Including learning something valuable from another individual. 
All transactions within STEAMcoin can be recorded for you to view to remember why you exchanged the coin. This will allow you to see what you've learned and how you are progressing in your career. 
Others can also view transactions that you are willing to share publicly. This will allow the community to see paths to success and see how others are using similar skills. It will also help provide a way to hire or be hired by others within the community to help increase what you and they are capable of accomplishing. 
STEAMcoin is also available for direct purchase. It can be used for crowdfunding projects within the community and for growing the community itself. 

If you see value in the community and the people in it, this coin provides a way for you to show that sentiment without all of the constraints of fiat currencies.
